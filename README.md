# mtb-rez-packages

Collection of packages for [Rez](https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez), mostly for VFX.  
I'm not a rez expert yet, so these are made while learning it and are prone to heavy changes.  
I'll try to add as much comments as possible and commits should be easy to read and understand.    
The idea is also to keep those working with both classic rez and bleeding-rez.

## Usage

Most of the included packages rely on `mtb_builld_tools` which is heavily inspired by the `rezutil` package of [allzpark's demo project](https://github.com/mottosso/allzparkdemo/tree/master/allzparkdemo/dev/rezutil)

## References
I was able to build it thanks to rez's wiki and those projects:
- [mottosso/bleeding-rez](https://github.com/mottosso/bleeding-rez.git)
- [predat/rez-packages](https://github.com/predat/rez-packages)
